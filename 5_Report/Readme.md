# Report of Wiper Control System :-
A Wiper Speed Control System Controls the operational speed of the wiper in accordance with the rain condition. This Wiper Speed Control System is used in all types of vehicles the main purpose is to clean the rain air drops present in front screen of the vehicles. It is very difficult to drive the vehicles in rain condition so in this case we will use wipers to clean the front screen of vehicles which is mirror so that we can drive the vehicles even in rain also .A wiper speed control system for an automotive wiper controls the operational speed of a wiper in accordance with rain conditions. The control system includes a rain sensor  detecting rain conditions to produce . an analog signal having an amplitude depending upon the detected rain conditions. The analog sensor signal is converted into a digital pulse signal by a converter  for application to a digital circuit system. A control signal is produced by digitally processing the pulse signal. The control signal is applied to a wiper driver circuit to adjust the operational speed or timing in accordance with the control signal.

So In this project, the mechanism of wiper speed control system is explored and hence initial press of a button is going the start of Engine.that is the ON Operation of the Engine. Then the other three remaining presses of the button are going to be the different levels of speed control offered by the designed of the controller ranging from low, medium and high.that's the speed control system what we can say . The Last press of the button is assumed to be the stop of Engine means OFF the Engine by pressing last button. The movement of the wiper arm control system from left to right and back again by the blinking of the blue, green and orange LEDs in the desired pattern.
# INTRODUCTION
Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe the raindrops or any water from the windscreen. Wipers are designed and made to clear the water from a windscreen. Most of cars have two wipers on the windscreen, one on the rear window and the other on each headlight. The wiper parts visible from outside the car are the rubber blade, the wiper arm holding the blade, a spring linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots. The wiper itself has about six parts called pressure points or claws that are small arms under the wiper .



In this project, there were two innovations reviewed as the literature review. The two were designed with different concept and operating mechanism however with same objective of working principle of the car wiper. The rain sensor was a highly versatile device for automatic wiping of vehicle windscreen when it is wet due to moisture, raindrops or even mud [2]. It worked by reflecting harmonious light beams within the windscreen. When raindrops fall onto the windscreen, this harmony light is been disturbed and creating a drop in the light beam intensity. The system then activated the wipers to be operated in full automatic mode. It has a response time at 0.1 seconds. It allowed for a quick reaction when it is a sudden splashes of water that will make the driver totally ‘blinds’ when the situation happened. With the automatic wiper, the driver can avert from the risk of an accident. The automatic wiper is important during the heavy traffic e.g. in town, city, school zone and other public place. A driver may be subjected to many distractions with bad weather, dangerous road conditions and fatigue. The Rain Sensor reduced the driver’s burden by making the driving more comfortable. Trailing a wet car is no longer a nuisance as detection of even 0.005 milliliters of water is possible.

## Features :-
1.It shall lock the car when button is pressed ONCE.

2.It shall open the car when button is pressed TWICE.

3.It shall wiper on and it moves clock wise direction when button is pressed THREE times.

4.It shall wiper off and it moves anti clock wise direction when button is pressed FOUR times.

5.It shall wiper complete one cycle when the button is pressed FIVE times.

## Aim :-
To prevent the Accidents During rain condition

## Research :-
Application is researched from various resources like from Google, YouTube and from Research Papers and then developed one application model called as wiper control system

## End Goal :-
1.Avoid Accidents and Provide safety environment

2.Clean Vision in weather conditions
